# Pantheon Demo

This is full stack application built around the [Pantheon library](https://github.com/carawarner/pantheon), a reddit-challenge-gone-wild which is also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pantheon-generator/).

## Setup

April 9th: the app is a skeleton. I'm working on the React part. Setup entails bundling the JS code so I can look at it in a browser:

Clone the repository.
```
npm install
npm run watch
```
Visit `file:///<...>/static/index.html` in a web browser.

# Wiki

The Pantheon Demo has a [wiki](https://github.com/carawarner/pantheon-demo/wiki) that is all about its tech stack.
